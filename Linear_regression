step - 1
importing libraries
         import the relevant libraries we needed
      once done
step - 2      
load the data 
           load the data which they asked us to predict
        once done
step - 3
read the data
          read the data to grab more about it

step - 4
visualize the data
           using distplot to check for any outliers or the data is normally distributed.
         once if u find it linearly distributed

step - 5
split the data
        X = independent variables , y = dependent variable
        
step - 6
train_test_split
              split the data so tht we can check the accuracy of original data with our predicted ones

step - 7
import regression - 
              import regression from sklearn
step - 8
assign regression to a variable
               assign it to a variable
step - 9
fitting
        fit x-train and y train to the data 
             fit the train set so  tht we can find the test set y - prices , x - feautures respectively
step - 10
finding stuffs
          find the intercept and coefficient and create a df to store them
                 use coefficient in df
step - 11
predict xtest
         predict the xtest value as we don't know its value
step - 12
plotting
        plot predicted X value with Y_test(known one)
          if we find a proper regression fit then our model is good

the basic assumption is we know the price values of the house , 
             we are creating an algorithm so tht it reduces the difference btw the original price
                what are the uses - uses in the sense once if our model is good we can find the price of unknown house using this
                      basically x_train is just to train the model , X_test helps in predicting how well it suits
                         creating an fitting model with x_train , and seeing how x_test acts on it with correspondece to y_test
                           finding coefficients in X_train , and checking whether its good or not...dot
                           
step - 13
calculating error
      from metrics we are calculating root mean square and other error for checking accuracy
      mean absolute error
      mean squared error
      root mean squared error
     
step - 14
conclusion
       we can conclude by saying tht if we have good accuracy our assumptions are good enough and fix the price accordingly
