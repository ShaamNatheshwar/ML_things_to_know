step 1 
 importing libraries
          import the relevant libraries\

step 2
  load the data
       load the data
step 3
  analyze
     analyze the data for missing stuffs
     
step 4 
    visualize 
         visualize where the missing data are to be found
         
step 5 
    overcome
          try to overcome / remove if it is way more

step 6 
   use function 
      say in titanic example we have to impute the age inorder to improve predictions
step 7
    view heat map again 
     make sure tht we don't have any such missing data
step 8
    convert to dummies
      convert the categorical variables into dummy variable so tht our ml will use tht
       use get dummies
        remove the first one
          and also remove the converted stuffs
            try removing other stuffs like name so on coz it has n unique stuffs
step 
 std scaler
 
step - 9
train test split
       split the data into 2 stuffs

step - 10
import log
      import logistic regress

step - 11
fit the train data

step - 12
predict it

step - 13
plot the graph

step - 14
check for precision using classification report
 for dropping multiple stuffs contain them in a single bracket
